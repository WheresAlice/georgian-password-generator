# welsh-password-generator

Website which generates passwords out of Welsh words.

Uses the form WordWordWord<digit>, so it's not very secure and you probably shouldn't actually use this.  But that's still a lot of different passwords it can generate.

Words come from this [Open Office](https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/gwirydd-sillafu-cymraeg-welsh-language-spell-checker) dictionary
